> Chapter 14 Graphs

### Definition and background
Graphs are widely used in Computer Science as well as in real-life when we need to make an optimal decision. In this chapter, we will be focusing on the basic terminology of the graph and its usage. A graph is made of vertices(V) and edges(E). There are three kinds of graphs: undirected, directed and labeled.

Terminology:
1. Incident: An edge connecting Vertices a and b is called the incident with a and b. The two vertices are called adjacent.
2. Simple path: all vertices on the path are distinct.
3. Cycle: A cycle is a path of length three or more that connects some vertex v1 to itself. A cycle is a simple cycle if the path is simple, except for the first and last vertices being the same.
4. Sparse Graph: A graph with few edges. A graph without cycles is called an acyclic graph.

### Implementations
All the methods are from [openDSA](https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/111334/modules/items/901534)
```
interface Graph { // Graph class ADT
  // Initialize the graph with some number of vertices
  void init(int n);

  // Return the number of vertices
  int nodeCount();

  // Return the current number of edges
  int edgeCount();

  // Get the value of node with index v
  Object getValue(int v);

  // Set the value of node with index v
  void setValue(int v, Object val);
  
  // Adds a new edge from node v to node w with weight wgt
  void addEdge(int v, int w, int wgt);

  // Get the weight value for an edge
  int weight(int v, int w);

  // Removes the edge from the graph.
  void removeEdge(int v, int w);

  // Returns true iff the graph has the edge
  boolean hasEdge(int v, int w);

  // Returns an array containing the indicies of the neighbors of v
  int[] neighbors(int v);
}
```

```
class GraphM implements Graph {
  private int[][] matrix;
  private Object[] nodeValues;
  private int numEdge;

  // No real constructor needed
  GraphM() { }

  // Initialize the graph with n vertices
  public void init(int n) {
    matrix = new int[n][n];
    nodeValues = new Object[n];
    numEdge = 0;
  }

  // Return the number of vertices
  public int nodeCount() { return nodeValues.length; }

  // Return the current number of edges
  public int edgeCount() { return numEdge; }
  
  // Get the value of node with index v
  public Object getValue(int v) { return nodeValues[v]; }
  
  // Set the value of node with index v
  public void setValue(int v, Object val) { nodeValues[v] = val; }

  // Adds a new edge from node v to node w
  // Returns the new edge
  public void addEdge(int v, int w, int wgt) {
    if (wgt == 0) return; // Can't store weight of 0
    matrix[v][w] = wgt;
    numEdge++;
  }

  // Get the weight value for an edge
  public int weight(int v, int w) { return matrix[v][w]; }

  // Removes the edge from the graph.
  public void removeEdge(int v, int w) {
    matrix[v][w] = 0;
    numEdge--;
  }
  
  // Returns true iff the graph has the edge
  public boolean hasEdge(int v, int w) { return matrix[v][w] != 0; }

  // Returns an array containing the indicies of the neighbors of v
  public int[] neighbors(int v) {
    int i;
    int count = 0;
    int[] temp;
    
    for (i=0; i<nodeValues.length; i++)
      if (matrix[v][i] != 0) count++;
    temp = new int[count];
    for (i=0, count=0; i<nodeValues.length; i++)
      if (matrix[v][i] != 0) temp[count++] = i;
    return temp;
  }
}
```

### Graph Traversals
In real life, there are often situations that need us to visit the vertices of a graph in a certain order. Similar to BST, we call this operation traversal of the graph. There are two essential things we need to consider: firstly, since we are starting from the vertex, we may or may not be able to traverse the whole graph. Secondly, the graph may contain a loop that we need to avoid since it may become an infinite loop. To solve this, we can mark the vertices to be "visited".


### Depth-First search(DFS) and Breadth-First search(BFS)
DFS is a common way for graph traversal.

Implementation from [openDSA](https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/111334/assignments/883590?module_item_id=901536)
```
static void DFS(Graph G, int v) {
  PreVisit(G, v);
  G.setValue(v, VISITED);
  int[] nList = G.neighbors(v);
  for (int i=0; i< nList.length; i++)
    if (G.getValue(nList[i]) != VISITED)
      DFS(G, nList[i]);
  PostVisit(G, v);
}
```
Note: Breadth-First search is also a widely used traversal algorithm.
Implementation from [openDSA](https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/111334/assignments/883590?module_item_id=901536)
```
static void BFS(Graph G, int v) {
  LQueue Q = new LQueue(G.nodeCount());
  Q.enqueue(v);
  G.setValue(v, VISITED);
  while (Q.length() > 0) { // Process each vertex on Q
    v = (Integer)Q.dequeue();
    PreVisit(G, v);
    int[] nList = G.neighbors(v);
    for (int i=0; i< nList.length; i++)
      if (G.getValue(nList[i]) != VISITED) { // Put neighbors on Q
        G.setValue(nList[i], VISITED);
        Q.enqueue(nList[i]);
      }
    PostVisit(G, v);
  }
}
```


### Topological Sort
In our life, we often encounter a series of tasks which needs to be done in order and quickly. In this case, we can organize the tasks into a linear order by building a directed graph according to the prerequisite of tasks. This process is called a topological sort.

Note: To get a solution, we can simply apply DFS to the graph we have. However, we have another solution called Queue-based solution which replace the use of recursion with a simple queue. Implementation from [openDSA](https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/111334/modules/items/901537):
```
static void topsortBFS(Graph G) {   // Topological sort: Queue
  Queue Q = new LQueue(G.nodeCount());
  int[] Count = new int[G.nodeCount()];
  int[] nList;
  int v;
  for (v=0; v<G.nodeCount(); v++) Count[v] = 0; // Initialize
  for (v=0; v<G.nodeCount(); v++) { // Process every edge
    nList = G.neighbors(v);
    for (int i=0; i< nList.length; i++)
      Count[nList[i]]++;            // Add to v's prereq count
  }
  for (v=0; v<G.nodeCount(); v++)   // Initialize Queue
    if (Count[v] == 0)              // V has no prerequisites
      Q.enqueue(v);
  while (Q.length() > 0) {          // Process the vertices
    v = (Integer)Q.dequeue();
    printout(v);                    // PreVisit for Vertex V
    nList = G.neighbors(v);
    for (int i=0; i< nList.length; i++) {
      Count[nList[i]]--;            // One less prerequisite
      if (Count[nList[i]] == 0)     // This vertex is now free
        Q.enqueue(nList[i]);
    }
  }
}
```


### Shortest-Paths Problems and Minimal Cost Spanning Trees
1. Shortest-Paths Problem
The problem of shortest-path has long existed since humans invent math. Now with the help of graph theory and computer, we can easily solve this kind of problem using specific algorithms. Solving this problem can be useful for different fields including business, information technology, even in our every meal-prep.
(Dijkstra Algorithm):
```
// Compute shortest path distances from s, store them in D
static void Dijkstra(Graph G, int s, int[] D) {
  for (int i=0; i<G.nodeCount(); i++)    // Initialize
    D[i] = INFINITY;
  D[s] = 0;
  for (int i=0; i<G.nodeCount(); i++) {  // Process the vertices
    int v = minVertex(G, D);     // Find next-closest vertex
    G.setValue(v, VISITED);
    if (D[v] == INFINITY) return; // Unreachable
    int[] nList = G.neighbors(v);
    for (int j=0; j<nList.length; j++) {
      int w = nList[j];
      if (D[w] > (D[v] + G.weight(v, w)))
        D[w] = D[v] + G.weight(v, w);
    }
  }
}
```

2. Minimal Cost Spanning Trees
Prim Algorithm: Prim's algorithm produces a minimum-cost spanning tree.
```
// Compute shortest distances to the MCST, store them in D.
// V[i] will hold the index for the vertex that is i's parent in the MCST
void Prim(Graph G, int s, int[] D, int[] V) {
  for (int i=0; i<G.nodeCount(); i++)    // Initialize
    D[i] = INFINITY;
  D[s] = 0;
  for (int i=0; i<G.nodeCount(); i++) {  // Process the vertices
    int v = minVertex(G, D);     // Find next-closest vertex
    G.setValue(v, VISITED);
    if (D[v] == INFINITY) return; // Unreachable
    if (v != s) AddEdgetoMST(V[v], v);
    int[] nList = G.neighbors(v);
    for (int j=0; j<nList.length; j++) {
      int w = nList[j];
      if (D[w] > G.weight(v, w)) {
        D[w] = G.weight(v, w);
        V[w] = v;
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### Kruskal's Algorithm and All-pairs shortest paths
Kruskal's algorithm is an example of the greedy algorithm

Key idea:
1. Count that there are v vertices and e edges in the Graph

2. Build a new graph, which has the same e vertices in the original graph, but no edges

3. Sort all e edges in the original graph Graph by weight from small to large

4. Loop: traverse each edge from the edge with the smallest weight until all nodes in the new graph are in the same connected component

For All-pairs shortest paths, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or Floyd Algorithm from [openDSA](https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/111334/modules/items/901544)
```
/** Compute all-pairs shortest paths */
static void Floyd(Graph G, int[][] D) {
  for (int i=0; i<G.n(); i++) // Initialize D with weights
    for (int j=0; j<G.n(); j++)
      if (G.weight(i, j) != 0) D[i][j] = G.weight(i, j);
  for (int k=0; k<G.n(); k++) // Compute all k paths
    for (int i=0; i<G.n(); i++)
      for (int j=0; j<G.n(); j++)
        if ((D[i][k] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) &&
            (D[k][j] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) &&
            (D[i][j] > (D[i][k] + D[k][j])))
          D[i][j] = D[i][k] + D[k][j];
}
```



> General Trees

### Definition and background
Different from specific trees like BST, 2-3 tree, and PR quadtree, the general tree, as it is called, represents the general existence of tree-like hierarchy in our life. The interface for a general tree is as follows: (from openDSA)
```
// General tree node ADT
public interface GTNode {
  public Object value();
  public boolean isLeaf();
  public GTNode parent();
  public GTNode leftmostChild();
  public GTNode rightSibling();
  public void setValue(Object value);
  public void setParent(GTNode par);
  public void insertFirst(GTNode n);
  public void insertNext(GTNode n);
  public void removeFirst();
  public void removeNext();
}

// General tree ADT
public interface GenTree {
  public void clear();      // Clear the tree
  public GTNode root();     // Return the root
  // Make the tree have a new root, give first child and sib
  public void newroot(Object value, GTNode first, GTNode sib);
  public void newleftchild(E value); // Add left child
}
```

Note: Similarily with other tresses, general tree naturally has three kinds of traversal: in-order, pre-order, and post-order.

### Union/Find
Terminology: We first use FIND to determines which disjoint that the given object belongs to. Then the UNION operation will combine the two disjoint sets if they are determined to be the member of the same equivalence class under the same equivalence relation.
For detailed information on, check:[openDSA](https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/111334/assignments/883587?module_item_id=901529)

### Sequential Tree Representations
The sequential tree is a very different tree structure to store a series of node values. The advantage is that it doesn't need to store any pointer, which saved a lot of space. However, we need to traverse all the nodes in the sequence before the goal node. The sequential can be used to serialize a tree structure so that a data structure can be transported between computers.
