> 7.11 Binary Search Trees

### Definition and background
Like many kinds of tress we've learned, the binary search tree is a powerful data-structure which was widely used to store ordered dataset. If we print the BST using Inorder, the result will be sorted from lowest to highest. This makes BST have a great advantage in managing a database where requires inserting, search, and delete data very efficiently.

Recursive plays an important role here.

Note: When we are removing one node, we need to consider whether it has both left and right sides. Since that will make it complex to decide which side we should use to fill out the blank.

### Time complexity analysis
The average time complexity for access, search, insert, and remove are all O(log(n)), the worst case for these are O(n).
The time complexity here depends on the order of insertion. If we insert the data using increasing order, the tree will be likely to have a one-sided structure that maximizes its height to n, thus cause the time complexity to become the worst case, O(n).
